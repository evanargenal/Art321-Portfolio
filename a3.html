            <h1>What is the "Lenny Face"?</h1>
            <p>
                ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) is an emoticon created with unicode character symbols. 
                The face is often used to spam forums and image boards, similar to the 
                Japanese word "desu". On 4chan, it has also come to be known as "Le Lenny Face" or "Le Face Face."

            <h1>What does my proposed net art do?</h1>
            <p>
                The goal of my net art is to input an image, select the face you want to have replaced, and the piece of art will do the
                rest of the work automatically. <br> <br>
                An example of the net art in action would be something like this:
            </p>
            <div id="beforeAndAfter">
                <img src="a3/curiousGeorgeBefore.png">
                <img src="a3/arrow.png" id="arrow">
                <img src="a3/curiousGeorgeAfter.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                Another example:
            </p>
            <div id="beforeAndAfter">
                <img src="a3/jerryBefore.jpg">
                <img src="a3/arrow.png" id="arrow">
                <img src="a3/jerryAfter.jpg">
            </div>
            <br> <hr> <br>
            <h1>How is such a masterpiece created?</h1>
            <p>
                To create the above images, photoshop can be utilized to create this effect. <br>
                All you need to do is select the face, blend it in so looks like there is no face,
                then paste a PNG of the Lenny Face in place of the original face. Finally, touch up the
                face and it adjust it so it doesn't look off. That's it!
            </p>
